# Getting-and-Cleaning-Data-Course-Project


  Unzip the data from https://d396qusza40orc.cloudfront.net/getdata%2Fprojectfiles%2FUCI%20HAR%20Dataset.zip and      rename the folder to "Data".
  Make sure the folder "Data" and run_analysis.R are in your working directory.
    
  Use source("run_analysis.R") command in RStudio.
    
  Two output files are generated in the current working directory:
  merged_data.txt that contains a data frame called cleanMerge and
  data_with_means.txt that contains a data frame called tidy_merged_data.txt.
        
  Use file_name <- read.table("tidy_merged_data.txt") command in RStudio to read the file.
